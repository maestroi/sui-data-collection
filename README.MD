# SUI Data Collection and Storage App

This Python application fetches data from a JSON-RPC endpoint and stores it in an SQLite database. It also periodically updates additional data and provides scheduling functionality.

## Features

- Fetches data from a JSON-RPC endpoint
- Stores data in an SQLite database
- Updates additional data periodically
- Runs on a schedule

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- `requests` library
- `sqlite3` module
- `json` module
- `schedule` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maestroi/sui-data-collection.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sui-data-collection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- Create a `config.json` file in the project directory and add the following content:

  ```json
  {
    "api_url": "https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443",
    "network": "testnet"
  }
  ```

  Replace `"https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443"` with the desired JSON-RPC API URL.

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The application will create the SQLite database (`network_data.db`) if it doesn't exist and start fetching and storing data based on the provided JSON-RPC API URL.

2. The application will run on a schedule, checking for updates every day at 20:00.

## Logging

The application utilizes the `logging` module to provide log messages. By default, the logs are displayed in the console. You can modify the logging configuration in the `main.py` file to redirect logs to a file or customize the log format.
